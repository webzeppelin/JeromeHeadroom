# Jerome Headroom
I am getting older. It's a problem that most people are facing each and everytime that they have a birthday. This time, I was turning 45.  While talking about numbers it should be noted that it was 106 degrees when I left Austin. It was 65 when we landed in Oakland. I have many good friends in the Bay Area. Very good people with big hearts and big minds. What better place to spend a birthday. When asked what I would like to do on my birthday, I decided that coding with some friends would be pretty fun. Thanks to Ewa, Rick, Jerome, and my lovely wife for making my wish of a birthday hackathon a reality.

More to come about this. We did nmake some progress but only had about 6 hours to put towards the effort. Hopefully will get a chance to contribute more soon.
